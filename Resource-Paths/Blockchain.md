# What Are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements (contracts). A smart contract consists of code that details the conditions that must be met for it to self-execute. The computer scientist, Nick Szabo, was the first person to propose the idea of smart contracts in 1996.

# What Is A Blockchain Explorer?

A blockchain explorer is a platform that allows people to search and navigate a blockchain. They're not necessary for using the blockchain. However, they offer a valuable service to those who wish to inspect a blockchain in detail. You can view transactions on the blockchain, smart contract code, account balances, and more.

# Who Created Solidity?

Solidity is a programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It was developed by Gavin Wood, Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, Liana Husikyan, Yoichi Hirai and other Ethereum core contributors to enable writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms.

# What Are ERC20 Tokens?

The Ethereum ERC-20 token standard is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. It was formalised in late 2015, and most Ethereum-based tokens use some variant of this standard. It is intended to be an open standard that any project can use or build upon. Projects often adhere to the ERC-20 standard to facilitate interoperability with other tokens on the platform.

# What Are ERC721 Tokens?

The ERC-721 standard is the Ethereum token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike ERC-20 tokens, each ERC-721 token is unique. Each token can represent something specific, making it helpful in tokenizing collectables.

# What Is Web3.JS?

Web3.JS is a popular JavaScript library that allows you to interact with the Ethereum network (and smart contracts). If you want to build an application, you can use Web3.JS to connect to the Ethereum blockchain and make the front-end of your application.

# What Is A Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, secured from tampering and revision. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, information cannot be altered without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.

# What Is Proof-Of-Work (PoW)?

Proof-of-Work is used to achieve consensus on a blockchain network by making it costly to produce new blocks. That prevents any single entity from being able to control the entire network by controlling more than 50% of the total hashing power of the system (i.e., energy spent performing computations). That makes it difficult for bad actors to disrupt the network's integrity by attacking it with overwhelming force.

# What Is Proof-Of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an algorithm by which a blockchain network aims to achieve a distributed consensus. In PoS-based networks, the creator of the next block gets chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the stake).

# What’s The Difference Between PoW And PoS?

In a PoW system, miners compete to find a solution to an equation that will allow them to add a block to the blockchain. In a PoS system, validators stake their cryptocurrency on the chain they want to mine. The more they stake, the more likely they will solve the next block. When they reach a consensus on a block, they get rewarded with more of the cryptocurrency. Critics argue that PoS may lead to centralization.

# What Is Ethereum 2.0?

Ethereum 2.0 is the next major step in the evolution of Ethereum (ETH). It will be a redesign of the network, incorporating new technical specifications that will allow for an increase in transaction throughput and other improvements.

# Who Is The Ethereum Foundation?

It is a non-profit foundation that launched in 2014 to promote and support the development of Ethereum. It does this in part by funding projects that support the Ethereum ecosystem, such as open-source software development and research & development projects. The Ethereum Foundation also organises workshops, hackathons and events to help drive the adoption of Ethereum.

# Where Can I Claim Test Ethereum?

Faucets sometimes stop working unexpectedly. If that happens, you can do nothing other than try again. But following are a bunch of faucets you can try:
• Rinkeby Faucets (Rinkeby, Alchemy)
• Goerli Faucets (Goerli, Slock It)
• Other Faucets (Chainlink)

# What Is Ethereum Classic?

Ethereum Classic was born from a fork of the Ethereum platform in July 2015. The fork occurred due to a disagreement about whether to reverse The DAO hack. Ethereum Classic is, therefore, a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain. You can learn more about the history of Ethereum here.

# What Is The Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a domain name service that allows users of Ethereum to mask their public addresses with human-readable addresses like "udemy.eth". Such addresses can send and receive tokens over the Ethereum network. Thus, making transacting easier than before.

# Why Does The Gas (Transaction) Fee Fluctuate?

It's helpful to understand how the Ethereum network operates to understand gas fees. You'll likely already be aware that the Ethereum network is a public ledger that records transactions between accounts. These transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the blockchain in sequential order, roughly every 12 to 14 seconds. As more people use the network, there will be increased competition for blockchain, thus higher fees.
