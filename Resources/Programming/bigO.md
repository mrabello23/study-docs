# Time and Complexity

- Big O notation: how code slows as data grows
- N: size of input or how much data
- time complexity (order):
  - constant time:
    - running time of a function stay constant even if the size of the input increases
    - represented by O(1)
    - T = a
  - logarithmic time
    - Logarithms are the mathematical inverse of exponentials
    - running time of a function grows very slowly as the input size grows
    - ex: Binary Search (algorithm that is used to search for an element in an ordered set)
  - linear time:
    - running time of a function increases as the size of the input increases
    - represented by O(n)
    - T = an + b
  - quadratic time:
    - running time of a function quadratic increases as the size of the input increases
    - represented by O(n²)
    - T = an² + bn + c
